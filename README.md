# Hi, I'm Leon ðŸ‘‹

I'm an IT-Specialst passionate about DevOps, open source and building cool things in my homelab environment.

Since gaining my initial experiences in my apprenticeship, I have been fascinated with the DevOps culture, cloud concepts, infrastructures and tools. I love that there is always more to learn, test and explore. Because of those initial experiences I decided to delve deeper into the world of homelabbing.

## Things I've Built

### Kubernetes Homelab

Secure Kubernetes Cluster running on Talos Linux.
